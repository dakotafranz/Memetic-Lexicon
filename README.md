# Memeic Lexicon

A language for the analysis of memes, meme-complexes, and the social movements they spawn.

I found this article on the late great Deoxyribonucleic Hyperdimension and decided that it should be given a proper rendering, as it has been so influential to my thinking. Hopefully you have found it useful, or at least provoking.

If you have thought about this before and wish to contribute to this lexicon send me a letter (dakota.franz@gmail.com) or just add an entry to the provided github page.
